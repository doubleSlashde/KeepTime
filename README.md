# KeepTime

# Use
Application to track your time spent on different projects each day. Aim was to create an easy and fast way to track the doings over the day. In the end you get a summary for the day.

Main view (when you hover over the app):\
![Alt text](/readme/images/main.png?raw=true "Main")
You can move the window by dragging it around.

If you don't hover over the application the project list collapses:\
![Alt text](/readme/images/standby.png?raw=true "Standby")

Open the context menu for a project to edit/delete or change the project and transfer n minutes of the current running one\
![Alt text](/readme/images/contextMenu.png?raw=true "contextMenu")

You can change the project by clicking in the project list, or by using the Hotkey feature (if activated in settings) Strg+Win button\
![Alt text](/readme/images/popup.png?raw=true "popup")

You can choose the used colors for the main window, if the project list should be left or right and if you want to use the Hotkey\
![Alt text](/readme/images/settings.png?raw=true "settings")

After a day you can open the Reports, which will summarize the work done for the different projects during the day\
![Alt text](/readme/images/report.png?raw=true "report")


**You need to close the application manualy before you shutdown your PC. Otherwise the last running project is not saved to database.**
